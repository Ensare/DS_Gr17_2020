Reading books is my pastime. Books are my never-falling friends. When I am out of tune with myself, I take recourse to reading
books by great writers and masterminds. I have read a number of books. Some books leave a profound influence upon our minds.
The book which has appealed to me the most is My Experiments With Truth, written by Mahatma Gandhi. It throws a flood of light
on his personality and thought. It is ideas and thoughts that have moved the world. This book centers round two things: Gandhiji’s
patriotism and his struggle for India’s freedom. He fought against injustice and inequality with the weapons of truth and non-violence.
The book brings out how Gandhiji awakened the sleeping Indians with his moral force and aroused in them a love for liberty.
The book also points out Gandhiji’s own weaknesses. To him, God was truth and truth was God. He never tried to conceal anything
about his life. He believed that politics should be tempered with morality. I like this book because it has proved a turning point
in my life. I have learnt a lot from this great book. It remains one of the most precious treasures of mankind. It makes a very good reading.
Every sentence of this book has a touch of sincerity. It is written in a simple but effective style. It is worth reading.
